# MVVM-Cookie-Clicker
Example game for my [Unity Weld talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRvscWS4r93pAvnYbw3YDYZti5q411csVXVP1joN6rFdBRwSEnzsivb44PW5-fvXBAOmmFsGIPRPw0M/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=60000#slide=id.g483ce4aaf4_0_0) at the [Brisbane Unity Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Brisbane-Unity-Developers/events/256315645/)

The project was set up with Unity 2018.2. All *models* are in the `Assets/Code/Models` folder, all *ViewModels* are in the `Assets/Code/ViewModels` folder, and the *views* are represented in the Unity scene, without code. For more info about how MVVM and Unity Weld work, check out Ashley Davis's [series of articles](http://www.what-could-possibly-go-wrong.com/bringing-mvvm-to-unity-part-1-about-mvvm-and-unity-weld/) on the topic.
